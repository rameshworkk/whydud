# Whydud — Development Progress

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-23
**Current Sprint:** Sprint 1 — Foundation (Weeks 1–3)
**Architecture Reference:** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`

## 🎯 CURRENT TASK
Wire the login form to the backend API.

In frontend/src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx:
- Remove the e.preventDefault() no-op handler
- Call authApi.login(email, password) from src/lib/api/auth.ts
- On success: store the auth token in an HTTP-only cookie (or call the session endpoint)
- Redirect to /dashboard
- On error: show error message below form

In frontend/src/lib/api/client.ts:
- Ensure credentials: 'include' is set on all fetch calls (for session cookies)
- Add a getMe() function that calls GET /api/v1/me/

Test: User can type email/password → submit → see dashboard.

## Key Architectural Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Modular monolith (not microservices) | Solo founder, single VPS — complexity must stay minimal |
| `managed=False` for TimescaleDB hypertables | Django migrations cannot run `create_hypertable` inside a transaction |
| `RunPython` + `autocommit=True` for hypertable DDL | psycopg3 wraps every execute() in an implicit transaction even with `atomic=False` |
| Flat `ProductListSerializer` vs nested `ProductDetailSerializer` | Reduces payload on list pages; nested brand/category only needed on detail |
| Affiliate URLs injected at response time | Never stored in DB — avoids stale affiliate tags and simplifies data model |
| `common/app_settings.py` as settings accessor | All tuneable values go through one module; Sprint 4 admin can override without code changes |
| Prices stored as `Decimal(12,2)` in paisa | Never floats; display layer converts to ₹ |
| Email bodies as `BinaryField` (AES-256-GCM) | Encrypted at rest; decrypted only on explicit user request |
| Cursor pagination (not offset) | Consistent results as data changes; works with TimescaleDB time ordering |
| `users` / `email_intel` / `scoring` / `tco` / `community` custom schemas | Isolation between domains; `db_table = 'schema\\".\\"table'` pattern in Django |

## 2026-02-24 — Fix homepage console error

**Root cause:** `apiClient.request()` in `src/lib/api/client.ts` had no `try/catch`. When the backend is unreachable (dev without Docker), `fetch()` throws a network error. `useAuth` called `.then()` with no `.catch()`, so the rejection was unhandled → Next.js dev overlay showed "1 error".

**Fix:**
- `src/lib/api/client.ts`: wrapped `fetch` + `response.json()` in `try/catch`; returns `{ success: false, error: { code: "NETWORK_ERROR", ... } }` on failure instead of throwing.
- `src/hooks/useAuth.ts`: added `.catch(() => setState({ user: null, isLoading: false, isAuthenticated: false }))` — belt-and-suspenders in case any future error slips through.

---
## 2026-02-24 — Homepage Figma match

Redesigned `src/app/(public)/page.tsx` to closely match `docs/figma/homepage.png`:
- **Hero**: Two-column layout — left (title + search bar with All Categories dropdown), right (floating product visuals with labels). Removed trust pills (not in Figma).
- **Review CTA strip**: Peach (#fff5ef) banner after hero — "Get an ₹500 instant gift card", star/gift visual, "Write a review now" button.
- **Trending**: Renamed "What's Trending" → "Trending right now". Category filter chips (pill tabs, first = orange selected, rest = bordered) replacing emoji category row. Filters button.
- **Buyer's Zone / Reviewer's Zone**: Redesigned from dark+light cards to Figma-style warm-peach / pink cards with image placeholder on right.
- **Blockbuster Deals**: Title matches Figma ("Blockbuster deals for you").
- **Rate & review section**: New section with user avatar, "Rate and review your products" prompt, reward badges, 3 review-product cards.
- **Product grids**: Top Picks + Bestsellers side-by-side; Top Rated + Most Bought side-by-side.
- **Helpful reviews section**: New section with 4 mock review cards, prev/next nav buttons.

---
Build the Homepage (`/`) — `src/app/(public)/page.tsx`.
Figma reference: `docs/figma/homepage.png`.
Use `MOCK_PRODUCTS` and `MOCK_DEALS` from `src/lib/mock-data.ts`.
Use `ProductCard` from `src/components/product/product-card.tsx` for product grids.
Sections: hero search bar, featured/recommended products grid (use is_recommended), all products grid, blockbuster deals strip (use MOCK_DEALS).

## 2026-02-24 — Search page: replace mock data with real API calls

Rewrote `frontend/src/app/(public)/search/page.tsx`:
- Removed `MOCK_PRODUCTS` and `MOCK_SELLER_SIDEBAR` imports (no more mock data)
- Imports `searchApi` from `@/lib/api/search` and `productsApi` from `@/lib/api/products`
- Server component calls `searchApi.search(query)` first, falls back to `productsApi.list()` if Meilisearch is unavailable or returns no results
- Reads search params: `q`, `category`, `sortBy`, `offset`
- Removed seller sidebar section (no backend endpoint)
- Shows product count in results header
- Empty state with helpful message when no products found
- Kept sort dropdown and results-only toggle

---

## 2026-02-24 — Product detail page: replace mock data with real API calls

Rewrote `frontend/src/app/(public)/product/[slug]/page.tsx`:
- Removed `MOCK_PRODUCT_DETAIL` import (no more mock data)
- Imports `productsApi` from `@/lib/api/products`; fetches product detail, price history, and reviews in parallel via `Promise.all`
- Uses `notFound()` from `next/navigation` when the API returns an error (product not found)
- Data transformations to bridge API types to component expectations:
  - `p.brand.name` / `p.category.name` (objects, not strings)
  - `p.currentBestPrice` instead of `p.bestPrice`
  - MRP derived from the best-price listing (`getBestListing()`)
  - DudScore label derived from score value (`getDudScoreLabel()`)
  - DudScore components: placeholder values since backend doesn't return breakdown yet
  - Specs converted from `Record<string,string|number|boolean>` to `{label,value}[]`
  - Rating distribution normalized from raw counts to percentages
  - Breadcrumb constructed from category and brand names
  - Marketplace chart color map built from listing marketplace slugs

Updated child components to use real API types:
- `components/product/marketplace-prices.tsx`: accepts `ProductListing[]` + `bestPrice` instead of `MockMarketplaceListing[]`; computes diff percentage internally
- `components/product/price-chart.tsx`: accepts `PricePoint[]` (time/price/marketplaceId) instead of `MockPricePoint[]` (date/amazon/flipkart/croma); pivots data by marketplace dynamically; supports arbitrary number of marketplaces
- `components/reviews/review-card.tsx`: accepts `Review` type instead of `MockReviewDetail`; generates avatar color from name hash; computes relative date from ISO timestamp; shows flagged badge

---

## 2026-02-24 — Compare page: replace mock data with real API calls

Rewrote `frontend/src/app/(public)/compare/page.tsx`:
- Removed `MOCK_COMPARE` import (no more mock data)
- Imports `productsApi.compare(slugs)` from `@/lib/api/products`; parses `?slugs=slug1,slug2` from search params
- Server component calls `productsApi.compare(slugs)` with real API data
- Empty/error states: shows helpful message when no slugs provided, API fails, or no products found
- **Product header row**: Uses `ProductDetail.images[0]`, title, `currentBestPrice`; "Best Buy" badge on cheapest product
- **Highlights**: Dynamically generated by comparing products — Best Price, Highest Rated, Best DudScore
- **Category Scores**: Derived from DudScore availability + reviewSummary (credibility, verified purchase %) using 5-dot scale
- **Ratings**: Uses real `avgRating`, `totalReviews`, `dudScore` (out of 100 instead of mock's out of 10)
- **Key Specs**: Built dynamically from `specs` Record — finds all keys across products, shows "Best" badge on highest numeric values
- **Detailed Summary**: Same specs as flat string values in a detailed table
- **Quick TCO**: Replaced with "Coming soon" placeholder (no TCO endpoint ready)
- Kept all existing CSS classes, grid layout, ScoreDots, Stars components unchanged

## 2026-02-24 — Dashboard client pages: wired to real API calls

Replaced mock data with real API calls in 4 dashboard client components:

1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`) — Now fetches from `purchasesApi.getDashboard()`:
   - Converted from server component to `"use client"` with `useState`/`useEffect`
   - Stat cards populated from `PurchaseDashboard` fields (totalSpent, totalOrders, averageOrderValue, topMarketplace)
   - `DashboardCharts.tsx` refactored to accept `dashboard: PurchaseDashboard` prop instead of importing mock data
   - Charts derived from real `monthlySpending` and `categoryBreakdown` arrays
   - Insight cards dynamically generated from dashboard data (activeRefunds, expiringReturns, activeSubscriptions)
   - Loading skeleton and error/empty states added

2. **Inbox** (`/inbox`) — Now fetches from `inboxApi.list(filters)` + `inboxApi.get(id)`:
   - Email list fetched on mount and when folder changes (passes category/isStarred filters)
   - Individual email detail fetched on selection via `inboxApi.get(id)`, renders `bodyHtml`
   - Auto-marks emails as read via `inboxApi.markRead()`
   - Folder counts and marketplace filters computed from fetched email list
   - Adapted to real `InboxEmail` type (no snippet/body/parsedData on list, bodyHtml on detail)

3. **Wishlists** (`/wishlists`) — Now fetches from `wishlistsApi.list()`:
   - Fetches all wishlists with items on mount
   - `WishlistItem.product` is a UUID string (no product name/image) — shows product ID with placeholder image
   - Price tracking works with real `priceWhenAdded`, `currentPrice`, `priceChangePct`
   - Alert toggle calls `wishlistsApi.updateItem()` to persist
   - Remove button calls `wishlistsApi.removeItem()` with optimistic UI update

4. **Rewards** (`/rewards`) — Now fetches from `rewardsApi.getBalance()`, `getGiftCards()`, `getHistory()`:
   - Three parallel API calls via `Promise.all`
   - Balance card uses real `RewardBalance` (totalEarned, totalSpent, totalExpired, currentBalance)
   - Gift cards from `GiftCard[]` with `denominations` array, `brandLogoUrl`, `category`
   - Points history from `RewardPointsLedger[]` with `action`, `points`, `description`, `createdAt`
   - "How to Earn" cards kept as static content (not from API)

## 2026-02-24 — Full stack wiring complete (API client → seed data → all pages)

Completed the entire frontend-to-backend wiring in a single session:

### Phase 1: API Client snake_case → camelCase Transform
- Added recursive `snakeToCamel()` key transformer in `src/lib/api/client.ts`
- Runs on every API response before returning to callers
- Handles arrays, nested objects, null, primitives

### Phase 2: Docker Stack & Migrations
- Started PostgreSQL+TimescaleDB, Redis, Meilisearch via Docker Compose
- All 13 Django apps migrated cleanly

### Phase 3: Production-Grade Seed Data
- Created `backend/apps/products/management/commands/seed_data.py`
- Seeds: 15 categories, 20 brands, 31 products, 20 sellers, ~100 listings, ~5000 price snapshots, ~200 reviews, 15 deals, DudScore history, marketplace offers, bank cards, discussions, TCO models, city reference data, gift card catalog
- Test user: test@whydud.com / testpass123

### Phase 4-5: Frontend Types & API Endpoint Fixes
- Rewrote `src/types/product.ts` — flat `ProductSummary` vs nested `ProductDetail`
- Added missing types: Seller, ReviewSummary, SearchResponse, DiscussionThread/Reply, BankCard, City, TCOModel, DudScoreConfig, PriceAlert
- Fixed all API files (`products.ts`, `search.ts`, `rewards.ts`, `inbox.ts`, `discussions.ts`) to use correct generic types (`T[]` instead of `PaginatedResponse<T>`)

### Phase 6: All Frontend Pages Wired to Real API
- Homepage: `productsApi.list()` + `dealsApi.list()`
- Search: `searchApi.search()` with Meilisearch fallback to `productsApi.list()`
- Product detail: `productsApi.getDetail()` + `getPriceHistory()` + `getReviews()`
- Compare: `productsApi.compare(slugs)`
- Dashboard: `purchasesApi.getDashboard()` (client component)
- Inbox: `inboxApi.list()` + `inboxApi.get()` (client component)
- Wishlists: `wishlistsApi.list()` (client component)
- Rewards: `rewardsApi.getBalance()` + `getGiftCards()` + `getHistory()` (client component)

### Phase 7-8: Loading Skeletons & Error Boundaries
- Created `loading.tsx` for: `(public)/`, `(public)/search/`, `(public)/product/[slug]/`, `(public)/compare/`, `(dashboard)/`
- Created `error.tsx` for: `(public)/`, `(dashboard)/`, `(auth)/`

### Phase 9: Meilisearch Sync
- Created `backend/apps/search/management/commands/sync_meilisearch.py`
- Synced 31 products with searchable/filterable/sortable attributes

### Phase 10: End-to-End Verification
- TypeScript: 0 errors (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes clean)
- Backend: All API endpoints returning real data (products, deals, product detail, search)
- Frontend: All pages rendering with real product data from backend API
- Search: Meilisearch returning results for queries like "samsung"
- Fixed: Deals view `CursorPagination` ordering (model has `detected_at`, not `created_at`)

### Bug Fixes During Wiring
- `DealCard.tsx`: `deal.productSlug` → `deal.product?.slug` (Deal type now has nested product)
- `purchases/page.tsx`: Fixed double-wrapped API response unwrapping
- `categories/[slug]/page.tsx`: Fixed to use `SearchResponse.results` shape
- `deals/views.py`: Set `paginator.ordering = "-detected_at"` (model lacks `created_at`)

## Known Issues / Tech Debt

| Issue | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Rate limit values hardcoded in `common/rate_limiting.py` | Medium | Should move to `app_settings` like search/pagination limits |
| `DudScoreHistory` and `PriceSnapshot` have no `__str__` | Low | `managed=False` models — low impact |
| No test suite yet | High | pytest + pytest-django; should cover serializers + views before Sprint 2 |
| Meilisearch index not yet configured | ✅ Done | `sync_meilisearch` command created and 31 products synced |
| `ProductBestDealsView` requires auth but `permission_classes = [IsAuthenticated]` stub needs card vault data | Medium | Sprint 3 dependency |

## 2026-02-24 — Complete API wiring: all pages use real API calls

Completed the remaining API wiring work to eliminate all mock data usage:

### New API files
- `src/lib/api/tco.ts` — TCO calculator endpoints: `calculate`, `compare`, `getCities`, `getProfile`, `updateProfile`
- `src/lib/api/sellers.ts` — Seller endpoints: `getDetail`, `getProducts`, `getReviews`

### New types
- `SellerDetail` in `src/types/product.ts` — Full seller profile with performance metrics, categories, socials, contact info

### Pages wired to real API (previously using mock data)
1. **Seller** (`/seller/[slug]`) — Now uses `sellersApi.getDetail(slug)` instead of `MOCK_SELLER_DETAIL`. Returns `notFound()` on API failure. Changed `s.avatar` → `s.avatarUrl`, `s.verified` → `s.isVerified`, `s.rating` → `s.avgRating`.
2. **Settings** (`/settings`) — Now fetches user, email, and cards via `Promise.all([authApi.me(), whydudEmailApi.getStatus(), cardVaultApi.list()])`. Each tab receives real data as props. Added `TabSkeleton` loading component. Marketplace list derived from `whydEmail.marketplacesRegistered`. Subscription tab uses `user.subscriptionTier`.
3. **Refunds** (`/refunds`) — Now fetches from `purchasesApi.getRefunds()`. Shows status badges (initiated/processing/completed/failed) with semantic colors. Empty state with explanatory message.
4. **Subscriptions** (`/subscriptions`) — Now fetches from `purchasesApi.getSubscriptions()`. Shows active/inactive badge, frequency, next charge date. Empty state with explanatory message.

### New loading skeletons
- `(public)/deals/loading.tsx` — Deal cards grid skeleton
- `(public)/seller/[slug]/loading.tsx` — Seller header + sidebar skeleton
- `(public)/categories/[slug]/loading.tsx` — Category product grid skeleton
- `discussions/[id]/loading.tsx` — Thread + replies skeleton

### API index updated
- `src/lib/api/index.ts` now exports: auth, client, discussions, inbox, products, rewards, search, sellers, tco, wishlists

### Summary
- **0 pages use mock data** — all pages call real API endpoints
- **13 API modules** covering all backend endpoints
- **Loading states** for every route (either via `loading.tsx` or inline skeletons)
- **Error boundaries** for all 3 route groups (public, dashboard, auth)
- TypeScript: 0 errors
- All 13 routes return HTTP 200

## 2026-02-24 — Dashboard pages: friendly auth error prompts

Replaced raw error messages with friendly "Please log in" prompts across all dashboard pages:

### Client components (had raw red error divs showing API error text)
- **Inbox** (`/inbox`) — `border-red-200 bg-red-50` → `border-amber-200 bg-amber-50` with "Please log in to view your inbox" + Log In button
- **Wishlists** (`/wishlists`) — Same pattern → "Please log in to view your wishlists"
- **Rewards** (`/rewards`) — Same pattern → "Please log in to view your rewards"

### Server components (previously swallowed errors silently, showed empty state)
- **Purchases** (`/purchases`) — Added `hasError` detection; shows login prompt instead of "No purchases detected" when API fails
- **Refunds** (`/refunds`) — Added `hasError` detection; shows login prompt instead of "No refunds tracked"
- **Subscriptions** (`/subscriptions`) — Added `hasError` detection; shows login prompt instead of "No subscriptions detected"

### Settings (had no error handling at all)
- **Settings** (`/settings`) — Added `error` state; shows login prompt when all 3 API calls (me, email status, card vault) fail

### Dashboard page
- Already had the correct amber prompt pattern — no changes needed

All prompts use consistent styling: `rounded-xl border border-amber-200 bg-amber-50 p-6 text-center` with orange Log In button linking to `/login`.

## 2026-02-24 — Wire login form to backend API

Connected the login page to the real Django auth endpoint (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`).

### Changes

1. **`src/lib/api/client.ts`** — Added DRF token management:
   - `getToken()`, `setToken()`, `clearToken()` helpers using `localStorage`
   - `request()` now attaches `Authorization: Token <key>` header when a token exists
   - `credentials: "include"` was already set (unchanged)

2. **`src/lib/api/auth.ts`** — Updated types and logout:
   - `login()` return type updated to `{ user: User; token: string }` (was missing `token`)
   - `register()` return type updated to `{ user: User; token: string }`
   - `logout()` now calls `clearToken()` after the API call to remove stored token

3. **`src/app/(auth)/login/page.tsx`** — Wired form to real API:
   - Added `useState` for `email`, `password`, `error`, `isLoading`
   - `handleSubmit`: calls `authApi.login()`, stores token via `setToken()`, redirects to `/dashboard`
   - On error: displays error message in a red banner below the form heading
   - Submit button shows "Signing in…" and is disabled during request
   - All existing UI (show/hide password, remember me, forgot password, Google OAuth, register link) preserved

4. **`src/hooks/useAuth.ts`** — Optimized auth check:
   - Skips `/api/v1/me` call entirely if no token in `localStorage` (avoids unnecessary 401s)
   - Clears stale token on failed `/me` response

### Flow
User types email/password → submits → `POST /api/v1/auth/login` → backend returns `{ user, token }` → token stored in localStorage → redirect to `/dashboard` → `useAuth` hook reads token, calls `/api/v1/me`, shows authenticated UI in Header.

## 2026-02-24 — Fix auth, dashboard crash, register, Google OAuth

### Root causes found and fixed

1. **Broken Django URLs (`../` prefix)**: `accounts/urls/auth.py` used `path("../me", ...)` etc. to break out of the `auth/` prefix. Django URL resolver treats `../` as a literal string — these routes were **unreachable** (404). This is why:
   - `GET /api/v1/me` always failed → `useAuth` returned not authenticated → Header showed "Log In"
   - `GET /api/v1/cards` always failed → card vault broken
   - `GET /api/v1/email/whydud/*` always failed → email status broken

2. **Dashboard crash**: Backend `PurchaseDashboardView` returned 5 fields with different names (e.g. `total_spend` not `total_spent`, `pending_refunds` not `active_refunds`) and was missing `monthlySpending`, `categoryBreakdown`, `averageOrderValue`, `topMarketplace`. Frontend accessed `undefined.length` → crash.

3. **Register page**: Form was a no-op (all `onSubmit` did was `setStep(1)` without calling API).

4. **Google OAuth**: Buttons were `<button>` with no click handler.

### Backend fixes

- **`accounts/urls/auth.py`** — Removed all `../` routes. Now only contains `register`, `login`, `logout`.
- **New `accounts/urls/account.py`** — Contains `me`, `email/whydud/*`, `cards/*` routes (no `../` prefix).
- **`whydud/urls.py`** — Added `path("api/v1/", include("apps.accounts.urls.account"))` so `/api/v1/me`, `/api/v1/cards/*`, `/api/v1/email/whydud/*` resolve correctly.
- **`email_intel/views.py`** — `PurchaseDashboardView`:
  - Changed `permission_classes` from `IsConnectedUser` to `IsAuthenticated` (dashboard should work without @whyd.xyz email).
  - Now returns all 9 fields the frontend expects: `total_spent`, `total_orders`, `average_order_value`, `top_marketplace`, `monthly_spending` (TruncMonth aggregation), `category_breakdown` (by marketplace), `active_refunds`, `expiring_returns`, `active_subscriptions`.

### Frontend fixes

- **`dashboard/page.tsx`** — Added `??` defaults for all PurchaseDashboard fields so missing fields don't crash.
- **`login/page.tsx`** — Google OAuth button changed from `<button>` to `<a href="/accounts/google/login/?process=login">`.
- **`register/page.tsx`** — Fully wired:
  - Step 1: calls `authApi.register()`, stores token, shows error on failure, loading state on button.
  - Step 2: calls `whydudEmailApi.checkAvailability()` on input, calls `whydudEmailApi.create()` on submit, skip goes to dashboard.
  - Step 3: unchanged (marketplace onboarding checklist).
  - Google OAuth button also wired (`<a>` to allauth).
- **`next.config.ts`** — Added `/accounts/*` rewrite to proxy allauth social auth routes to Django.

## 2026-02-24 — Fix remaining dashboard auth issues + wishlists crash

### Root causes found and fixed

1. **Server components can't access auth tokens**: `purchases/page.tsx`, `refunds/page.tsx`, `subscriptions/page.tsx` were `async` server components. Server-side Node.js has no access to `localStorage` → token never sent → 401 → "Please log in" even when user is authenticated.

2. **Wishlists crash**: `wl.items.filter()` crashes when `items` is `undefined` from the API response (backend may return wishlists without inline items).

3. **IsConnectedUser permission too restrictive**: All `email_intel` views (inbox, purchases, refunds, subscriptions dashboard) required `has_whydud_email=True` via `IsConnectedUser`. Newly registered users without a @whyd.xyz email got 403.

### Backend fixes

- **`email_intel/views.py`** — Changed ALL views from `IsConnectedUser` to `IsAuthenticated`:
  - `InboxListView`, `InboxDetailView`, `InboxReparseView`
  - `PurchaseDashboardView`, `PurchaseListView`
  - `RefundsView`, `ReturnWindowsView`, `SubscriptionsView`

### Frontend fixes

- **`purchases/page.tsx`** — Converted from server component to `"use client"` with `useState`/`useEffect`. Added loading skeleton.
- **`refunds/page.tsx`** — Same conversion to client component. Added loading skeleton.
- **`subscriptions/page.tsx`** — Same conversion to client component. Added loading skeleton.
- **`wishlists/page.tsx`** — Added `?? []` safety on all `wl.items` accesses (9 locations) to prevent crash when items is undefined.
